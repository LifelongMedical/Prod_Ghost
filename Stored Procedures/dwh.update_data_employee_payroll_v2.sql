--- **DQ** , Need to create a routine that assigns missing homecost number worked in by file number for new hires to the cost number that is inputted in their subsequent payrolls for new hires
--Also noted that we are dropping FTE for internal transfers on rehire payrol (first) they do not get a cost number worked in.
--The Rehire logic is they get a term date and a rehire date, during transition it looks like cost number worked in is dropped
--The internal transfers are not counted as terms because the payroll continues (No change to file number)
--We could create an internal transfer FTE.  Same logic as termination except wouldn't be last term but no last row requirement.  Would instead use rehire date in
--as tight window (<14 days) to grab that payroll as a flag for internal transfer.
        SELECT
